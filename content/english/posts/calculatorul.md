A computer, also called a computing system, s a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. The classical computers that we currently use perform logical operations using bits - a stream of electrical or optical pulses representing binary formulas consisting of 1 or 0. A regular computer stores and processes information with the help of transistors.

In any task of the computer, the process is the same: an algorithm manipulates a series of bits, where each bit is either 0 or 1 (input), the result of which is a new bit string (output).
